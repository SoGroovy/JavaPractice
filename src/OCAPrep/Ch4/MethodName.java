    By convention, method names start with a lower case, but ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

    public void walk1() {}
    public void 2walk() {} (DOES NOT COMPILE because cannot begin method name with numbers)
    public walk3 void() {} (DOES NOT COMPILE because walk3 is not a valid return type; it should be the method name)

    public void() {} (DOES NOT COMPILE method name is missing)
