    3 ways to construct StringBuilder:
    1) StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();
    2) StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
    3) StringBuilder sb3 = new StringBuilder(5);
    method .size() shows how many characters in StringBuilder object
    method .capacity() shows the amount of characters the StringBuilder can hold

    They both similar things, but StringBuffer does it more slowly because it is thread safe.
